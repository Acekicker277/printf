# Printf  üì†

# Description ‚è≥
The printf function sends formatted output to stdout. A custom `_printf()` for learning purposes was developed by cohort #12 students Oyetola Ayobami and Blessing Ojediran. `_printf()` function format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. These arguments are placed using the percentage `'%'` operator

# Authorized functions and macros
`write (man 2 write) malloc (man 3 malloc) free (man 3 free) va_start (man 3 va_start) va_end (man 3 va_end) va_copy (man 3 va_copy) va_arg (man 3 va_arg)`
# Compilation
The code must be compiled this way:

`*$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic .c`

As a consequence, be careful not to push any c file containing a main function in the root directory of your project (you could have a test folder containing all your tests files including main functions)

The main files will include your main header file (holberton.h): #include holberton.h
